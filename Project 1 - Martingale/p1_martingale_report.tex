\begin{abstract}
	In this report, we review the findings from the first project of the Fall 2025 semester of CS7646 - Machine Learning for Trading (ML4T). This project centered around writing code to simulate a given betting strategy on an American roulette wheel. The results of this simulation were then analyzed, allowing the student to gain a basic understanding of probability, risk, and statistical tools that will be utilized for the remainder of the course. An additional objective of this project was to familiarize the student with the course's workflow including the development environment, policies and standards, and submission process.
